# Clarinet

Clarinet is a Clarity runtime packaged as a command line tool, designed to facilitate smart contract understanding,
development, testing and deployment. Clarinet consists of a Clarity REPL and a testing harness, which, when used
together allow you to rapidly develop and test a Clarity smart contract, with the need to deploy the contract to a local
mocknet or testnet.

Clarity is a **decidable** smart contract language that optimizes for predictability and security, designed by
Blockstack. Smart contracts allow developers to encode essential business logic on a blockchain.
